The page should greet the user with a welcome message, while having a button to start the game.
The game should select/generate a hidden "winning" word randomly.
The selected word should be an actual word not just any String.
The player will have 6 guesses/tries.
The player input should be a valid word not just any guesses.
If the player enters an invalid word it shouldn't accept it and gets counted as a try.
Depending on how many tries the player got the word, it should show a small congratulations message.
Each word will be tested to check the different states.
Each letter of the words guessed will be highlighted with one of three colors.
Dark Grey/Black will be for the letters that aren't in the "winning" word.
Yellow indicates that the letter exists, but not in the right position.
Green is for when the letter is in the correct place.
The player can only win if all the letters are green.
The colors should also be highlighted in the page keyboard.
The keyboard in the page should also work when clicked, displaying the corresponding value.
